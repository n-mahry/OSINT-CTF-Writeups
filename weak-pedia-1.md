### üß† Thought Process

#### Step 1: Analyze the Clue
The challenge refers to someone named **"Cooper"** who:
- Boarded something (likely a plane),
- Had a mysterious identity (‚Äúnot who he looked like‚Äù),
- Was involved in a **ransom** situation,
- And had a **portion of the ransom found 9 years later**.

These keywords point directly to the famous unsolved case of **D.B. Cooper**.

#### Step 2: Research the Case
Using OSINT (Wikipedia, Google), we find:

- **D.B. Cooper** (alias Dan Cooper) hijacked **Northwest Orient Flight 305** on **November 24, 1971**, demanding **$200,000 in ransom**.
- After receiving the money, he **parachuted out of the plane mid-flight**, never to be seen again.
- The FBI never conclusively identified him.

#### Step 3: Confirm the "Ransom Found" Detail
The challenge mentions that **9 years later**, part of the ransom was discovered.

From Wikipedia and FBI records:
- In **February 1980**, **$5,800** in deteriorating $20 bills was found by an 8-year-old boy named Brian Ingram along the Columbia River in Washington State.
- The serial numbers matched the ransom money given to D.B. Cooper in 1971.

Even though the exact time span is 8 years and a few months, it‚Äôs commonly referred to as **9 years later** in casual recounting ‚Äî aligning with the challenge‚Äôs narrative.

#### Step 4: Determine "When was this?"
While the ransom was found in **1980**, the question "When was this?" refers to the **original event** of Cooper **boarding the plane and hijacking it** ‚Äî not when the money was found.

This is supported by:
- The wording "Those days nobody thought..." clearly referencing **the hijacking date**.
- The identity mystery and "boarding" all happened on **November 24, 1971**.
